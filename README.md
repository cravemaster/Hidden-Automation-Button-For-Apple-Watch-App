# iBackupBot Hacks for Non-JB iOS Devices

*CURRENTLY ONLY FOR THE WATCH APP/APPLE WATCH APP*

If you have an iOS 9 device, put this in your iBackupbot folder for your backup you made in iTunes. "/System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences."

Now if you're jailbroken, simply disregard this: IS10 already has this feature. Just navigate to Settings->"InternalSettings10"->"Enable Automation" toggle under the "Apple Watch App Settings Section" to enabled. You could use this on a jailbroken phone but what's the point? :P

With iFile, put it in "/var/mobile/Library/Preferences" and respring your device or kill the Watch app and it should appear immediately on the screen.


Not tested on iOS 8.2/8.3/8.4 etc.
Although by @hamzasood it worked fine for him on his iPhone 6 Plus back when iOS 8.2 was released but was not publically jailbroken.

Works on iOS 10.x.x AS LONG AS YOUR DEVICE IS JAILBROKEN, as Apple officially put a chekc that REQUIRES an internal install on iOS 10. Sad :(.
