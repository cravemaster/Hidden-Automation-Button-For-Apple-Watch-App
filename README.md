# Enable the hidden Automation UI button in the Apple Watch app (using this on iOS 10 requires jailbreak. iOS 8.2 and iOS 9 don't.)

Put this "com.apple.nanobuddy.automationhelper.plist" in iBackupBot's "System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences".

It was tested by @hamzasood it worked for him on his iPhone running iOS 8.2. And also, @angelXwind tested it on iOS 8.1.2 on one of her devices (assuming a 5S?), and she also reported that it works fine for her - as she ported the Apple Watch files from iOS 8.2 - to her jailbroken iOS 8.1.2 device.

On iOS 10, things are different. iOS 10 now requires you to have an internal install to use the Automation button (so you **need** to use jailbreak).

*****IF YOU ARE USING iOS 10 AND ARE RUNNING A JAILBREAK, YOU MUST INSTALL INTERNALSETTINGS10 AND ENABLE THAT UNDER Settings->InternalSettings10->Enable Automation UNDER THE Apple Watch App Settings Section PART OF SAID INTERNALSETTINGS10**.
