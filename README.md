# Enable the hidden Automation UI button in the Apple Watch app (iOS 10 requires jailbreak. iOS 8.2 and iOS 9 don't.)

Put this "com.apple.nanobuddy.automationhelper.plist" in iBackupBot's "System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences".

It was tested by @hamzasood it worked for him on his iPhone running iOS 8.2 was released but was not publically jailbroken. And @angelXwind tested it on iOS 8.1.2 on one of her devices (assuming a 5S?), and she reported that it works fine for her as she ported the Apple Watch files from iOS 8.2 to her device.

On iOS 10, things are different. iOS 10 now requires you to have an internal install of it (so jailbreak).
