# Unlock the hidden Automation button in the Apple Watch app

Back up your device and put this "com.apple.nanobuddy.automationhelper.plist" file in iBackupBot's "System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences".


On iOS 10, things are different. iOS 10 now requires you to now have an internal install to use the Automation button (so you **need** to use jailbreak and install InternalSettings10 to unlock).

**IF YOU ARE USING iOS 10 AND ARE RUNNING A JAILBREAK, YOU MUST INSTALL INTERNALSETTINGS10 AND ENABLE THAT UNDER Settings->InternalSettings10->Enable Automation UNDER THE Apple Watch App Settings Section PART OF INTERNALSETTINGS10**.
