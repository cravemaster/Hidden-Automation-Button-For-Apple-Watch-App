# Enable the hidden Automation UI button in the Apple Watch app (using this on iOS 10 requires jailbreak. iOS 8.2 and iOS 9 don't.)

Put this "com.apple.nanobuddy.automationhelper.plist" in iBackupBot's "System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences".

This hack was originally found by @hamzasood it worked for him on his iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 8.2. Also, @angelXwind tested it on her iOS 8 device - she apparently ported the Apple Watch app to her device, and she also reported that the Automation button unlock hack evidently works fine for her.

On iOS 10, things are different. iOS 10 now requires you to now have an internal install to use the Automation button (so you **need** to use jailbreak and install InternalSettings10 to unlock).

**IF YOU ARE USING iOS 10 AND ARE RUNNING A JAILBREAK, YOU MUST INSTALL INTERNALSETTINGS10 AND ENABLE THAT UNDER Settings->InternalSettings10->Enable Automation UNDER THE Apple Watch App Settings Section PART OF INTERNALSETTINGS10**.
